# Turing machine simulator
A Turing machine simulator written in C++ along with programs for running some fundamental functions on it.

The simulator is present in "simulator.cpp". The simulator takes "program.txt" as the input program, specifies an initialization and input and runs the Turing machine.

The programs for each of decimal addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are present in the "Programs" folder. The code written to generate these text file programs is present in the "Generators" folder.
